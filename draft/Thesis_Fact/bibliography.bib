abstract = {The Schwinger model is quantum electrodynamics with massless fermions in two dimensions. It is known that the asymptotic states of the theory contain no states corresponding to free fermions (“quark trapping”) and that local charge conservation is spontaneously broken (“Higgs phenomenon”). We investigate to what extent these phenomena persist when the fermion is given a bare mass. We find quark trapping but no Higgs phenomenon. The second of these results is dependent on mass perturbation theory; the first is not.}

abstract = {The massive Schwinger model is quantum electrodynamics of a Dirac particle of mass m and charge e in 1 + 1 dimensions. It is known that the physics of the model depends on an arbitrary parameter independent of e and m, an angle, θ,|θ| ⩽ π. I give a physical explanation of this angle, and explain why a corresponding parameter does not appear in (3 + 1)-dimensional electrodynamics. I also compute some quantitative properties of the theory for both weak coupling, e ≪ m, and strong coupling, e ≫ m, and conjecture a qualitative description of the model that interpolates smoothly between weak and strong coupling. A typical quantitative result is that for weak coupling and |θ| ≠ π, the number of stable particles in the theory is 4m2πe21(1−θ2/π2)[23−In(2+3]+O(1) I do similar computations for a generalization of the model with “flavor SU(2), ” i.e., with two fermions of equal charge and mass. For weak coupling the results are very much like those for the massive Schwinger model, but for strong coupling there are some surprising differences.}

One of the most important consequences of our no-go theorem is that is not possible, in strong interaction models, to solve the notorious species doubling problem of Dirac fermions on a lattice in a chirally invariant way.}

The problem is reduced to the quantum mechanics of N degrees of freedom in which the potential needs to be self-consistently determined by its ground-state wavefunction and spectrum with given values of the  parameter, fermion masses, and temperature. Boson masses and fermion chiral condensates are evaluated. In the N = 1 model the anomalous behaviour is found at  and . In the N = 3 model an asymmetry in fermion masses  removes the singularity at  and T = 0. The chiral condensates at  are insensitive to the asymmetry in fermion masses, but are significantly sensitive at . The resultant picture is similar to that obtained in QCD by the chiral Lagrangian method.}

abstract = {Two possible ways of extending Symanzik's improvement programme to lattice fermions namely improvement to first and second order in the lattice sppacing a are discussed. The corresponding lattice actions for fermions are constructed and tree-level improvement conditions are derived by considering “classical” improvement. The concept of “on-shell” improvement is generalized to the lattice fermions studied here and the free parameters are determined for O(a) and O(a2) on-shell improved actions to all orders of perturbation theory. No evidence is found that the complicated structure of the O(a2) on-shell improved action, especially thearising fermion contact terms can be removed beyond tree level. The effect of terms in the action that explicitly break chiral symmetry and therefore remove the phenomenon of species doubling are investigated by considering the energy-momentum relations of the arising tree-level improved actions. Our main result is that the O(a) improved action is a slightly modified Wilson fermion action can still be written with only nearest-neighbour fermion interactions.}
